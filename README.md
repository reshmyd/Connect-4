# Connect-4
Built a two player game of Connect-4 using HTML, CSS & vanilla JS.
The program is broken into small functions each carrying out one task.
Its programmed to search for a winner horizontally, vertically and across two diagonals after the 7th turn. If it finds one the game is terminated and the user is given an option to restart a new one.
